# Path of Diablo Filter

A simple filter that:
* hides potions based on level
* hides gems based on level
* hides non magical items based on level
* applies custom color to some items to improve visibility
* decorates other items with more information:
  * `eth` flag for ethereal
  * item level for charms, amulets, rings
  * number of sockets
  * price for non magical items
  * item tier (yellow = exceptional, red = elite)
